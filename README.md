### outstanding questions
+ Should we require registration for either event? Would help folks organize around projects beforehand, but may also create barrier to attendance. 
+ Can we give demographic survey or would we need to consult IRB?

### codeFests

Often groups of 2-5 individuals form around a project, such as building a new data visualization, writing a document, or collaboratively investigating a problem. Participants take out their laptops, connect to power and wifi, and get working.


**structure** 

Hacking begins with project introductions. 

Participants that bring projects to the event have an opportunity to briefly (1 minute max) explain what they are working on at the very start of the event so that other participants can join that project. At the end of the event, a wrap-up session gives each project a chance to demonstrate some accomplishments.


+ look for coffee/snack/food sponsor since Cynthia can't swing food for folks? 

+ make folks register (eventbrite could be useful, or GitHub issue with template might be good)
  + template should include: 
    Name (and possibly other information as required by venue security)
    Email address
    Are they new to hackathons?
    What are they interested in hacking on? (free form question)
    Special needs/requests

+ have hashtag associated with each codeFest, and a general #geauxCode hash for general tweets. 
+ consistently have time at beginning for intro of idea, organizers, plug for data science concentration, logistics, code of conduct, etc. etc. etc. etc., make plug for Futures Fund, 
+ ideation should come before the event for codeFests, along with solicitation of group members, meaning that I am expecting students to get it fast, including setting up GitHub, etc. etc. 

+ level will likely be on par with this (https://www.angelhacks.org/). 













### makerSpaces


makerSpaces are fundamentally different, in that students may work in teams, but may work individually to construct a hardware project that may have software underneath. The most important bits here are the ordering of supplies. We have to get everything that a student might need to construct their thing. 



Good list of things in the makerSpace playbook in this directory. Shorter list here:

+ hand tools (glue gun, soldering iron, screwdriver, pliers, hex wrench, dremel, tweezers, scissors)
+ electricity tools (wirecutter/stripper, multimeter, power supplies, batteries,    )
+ computing tools (arduino, raspberry pi, LED panels, loads of LEDs,  breadboards, motors, lots of connectors, various sensors, 
+ build tools (       )
+ storage tools (containers, labels, rags,  )
+ safety (glasses, cleaners, silicone mats,  )
