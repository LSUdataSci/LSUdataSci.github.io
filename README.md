### What are codeFests?

codeFests, also referred to as _code festivals_, _hackathons_, or _hackfests_ are short events where students will be challenged to create a product using creativity and code, limited only by imagination and time (as these events will be 3 hours). More on the general structure is available [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon). 



### What are makerSpaces?

makerSpaces are collaborative workspaces where students can come learn and build things with microcontrollers and microcomputers. Students will have access to a wide range of different technologies, allowing them to construct, program, and create. Some examples of possible projects are available [here](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/10-raspberry-pi-projects-beginners/) but this is not exhaustive.
