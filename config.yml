  About: "We are a group of biologists and data scientists at Louisiana State University who are inviting you to participate in codeFests and makerSpaces. These are monthly events focused on providing a creative and educational outlet for students interested in writing code and building small hardware projects. By doing so, we aim to build interdisciplinary connections across the College of Science, foster creativity and teamwork, and provide students experience in data science. For more information on upcoming events, please see the Schedule or check us out on GitHub (https://github.com/lsuDataSci).
